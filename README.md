# Ta-Da To-Do weekend Project

_Duration: 2 Day Sprint_

This is a to-do, or task management app. You may add tasks, remove them, as well as mark them as complete. All of the added tasks are displayed on-screen.

### Prerequisites

## Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1. Go to localhost:5000 .
2. Click on the input field that says 'Add task'.
3. Input the task you want to enter.
4. Notice the task getting put on-screen.
5. If you don't want the task anymore, click the 'Remove' button and it will go away.
6. When you finish the task, click the 'Finished' button, and the task will be highlighted in light green.
